# Convert2Nex

A quick a dirty Python script for converting a .xlsx file to .nex file with some relevant commands for use with MrBayes.

Please refer to the [instructions](https://github.com/tim-forrer/Convert2Nex/blob/master/Instructions%20for%20convert2nex.pdf) for the specifics regarding how the .xlsx file should be laid out amongst other things.

## Usage

A detailed guide can be found in the [instructions](https://github.com/tim-forrer/Convert2Nex/blob/master/Instructions%20for%20convert2nex.pdf) but here's a quick low down.

To use these scripts, please download both "script.py" and "convert2nex.py", ensuring that they are in the same directory. You will need *Python 3.6+* on your system. You will also need the module **xlrd** which can be installed on your machine by running the following command in your terminal/command prompt:

`python -m pip install xlrd`

You will need to edit "script.py" appropriately so that the script can find your .xlsx file and where the data is located in that file. Refer to the [instructions](https://github.com/tim-forrer/Convert2Nex/blob/master/Instructions%20for%20convert2nex.pdf) for further info.
